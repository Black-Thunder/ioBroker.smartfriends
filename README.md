## smartfriends adapter for ioBroker

This adapter enables a direct **local integration** of the **SmartFriends Box** (e.g. Smart Friends Box by Schellenberg, ABUS, Paulmann, STEINEL, etc.) into ioBroker – **without using the official cloud**.

The adapter establishes a direct connection to the gateway to control and query devices locally.
